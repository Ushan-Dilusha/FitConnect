Brief Description -
Our project focuses on developing a social networking platform tailored specifically for fitness enthusiasts, providing a space for them to connect, share experiences, and support each other on their fitness journeys. Users will have the ability to follow other members, like and comment on posts, and receive notifications, while also being able to create their own posts featuring workout routines, progress updates, and dietary insights. Our platform will be accessible as a web application, ensuring security with OAuth-based authentication to protect user information. We have chosen a technology stack that includes Spring Boot for the backend, react for the frontend, MongoDB as the database, and Spring Security for authentication and authorization, guaranteeing a robust and secure platform for our users. Here are the key functionalities of our fitness-focused social media web application,

1. Post Creation: Users can create posts with uploaded media files, including photos or videos, and add descriptions. We ensure data validation for correct formatting and adherence to length restrictions.

2. Media Upload: Users can upload up to three photos or videos showcasing fitness activities. Videos are limited to 30 seconds, and we enable direct acceptance of media files from user devices.

3. Workout plan Management: For workout plans, users can generate, modify, and remove plans using templates for routines, exercises, sets, and repetitions. Customization options align plans with changing fitness objectives.

4. Workout Status Update: Users can share ongoing workout progress updates, using templates for workout metrics and concise descriptions of achievements.

5. Meal Plan Management: Meal planning features allow users to create, modify, and remove plans, inputting recipes, nutritional details, and serving sizes. Plans can be organized based on dietary preferences like vegan or keto options.

6. Data validation and Error Handling: We validate input data for consistency and integrity, with error-handling mechanisms for informative user messages.

7. User Authentication and Authorization: Authentication verifies user identities securely, while authorization rules control endpoint access based on user roles and permissions.
